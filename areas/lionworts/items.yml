        With trembling paws, you insert the toad-shaped key into the keyhole in the Lion’s nostril. A low growl emanates from the iron Lion head, and a heavy <i>ka-chunk!</i> sound follows from the gate. As if in response, you hear a cacophony of crows squawking and a night owl screeching far off in the woods ahead. 

        The gate whines as it creeps open, and the stone path continues into the rainy forest.

        You look up to see a strange green glow gleaming from the toad’s jeweled eyes. Her mouth suddenly widens, and a deep froggy voice echoes down from the statue:

        <i>“Fur and scales, mud and smoke,
        Toads with manes and Cubs that croak!
        Frogs and lions, friends in rhyme,
        Across the realm and throughout all time.”</i>

    The massive circular stone at the center of the room once processed raw grain and ground it to flour.

Both are scored with innumerable grooves to allow grains to spill in from the hopper above and for flour to spill out the sides into wooden collection troughs below.

    You are looking intently at the intricate lattice of grooves on the wheel when you notice incredibly fine silver tracings around the entirety of the millstone.

    Who told a scurrilous tale with no more than a look,
    He wagered for baubles, but lost to a crook,
    Who took its black feathers and here left it be-plooked.”</i>

    O, Cubling. What strange wonders hath fortune wrought for you this night? 

    You gaze into the depths of the mirror, but it is a moment before your reflection comes into focus in the dark glass. What you see there transfixes you utterly.

    Your reflection stands looking out from the mirror, but it is no longer a Cub. Instead, you see an adult Lion, shrouded in heavy dark robes and holding a staff. It is unmistakably you, but much older. Your face looks heavy with grief, but softens into wonder upon seeing you in your present younger form.

    Younger Cub and older Lion study each other for a moment, amazed.

    Suddenly, your reflection has a realization, and begins to try to tell you something, frantically. No sound emanates from the glass. You shake your head to tell your reflection you cannot hear.

    You watch the Lion’s mouth and their elaborate, desperate gestures. You think you can make out a few words “speak,” “four,” “poem,” and “door.” You’re trying to makes sense of these words when you catch sight of something that fills you with abject horror... a sinister shape is moving unseen toward the back of your reflection, a large slithering thing in the darkness. You point and shout for your reflection to turn around and see the danger but it doesn’t seem to understand you.

    A thought comes to you, a possible way to warn your future self about the slithering danger behind them. Thinking quickly, you shout and spin around, forcing your reflection to do the same in the glass.

    Your heart pounds and your fur bristles. You gasp for breath.

    Were you too late? What happened to the older you?!

    Despite your desperation and confusion, you dare not turn to look back at the glass, lest you accidentally force the older Lion to turn its back on the dangers that await it on their side of the mirror.

    You are left to try to make sense of the four words and why they seemed so important…

    You try to steady your nerves and force yourself to continue.

You reach out a paw to open it and see what is inside when suddenly the sack shifts violently, and emits a terrible smell. So startled are you by the bundle that you let out a yelp and fall back onto the bricks. Your instincts scream at you that whatever is inside <i>must not be let out.</i>

Its bent and sculpted branches look like dark amber in the rain, and are woven through with wicked thorn brambles. You know it is just a bush, but the flickering glass eyes study you with unmistakable malice. In its bared fangs is a <strong>red rose</strong>.

    The moss is at least several inches thick, especially in the large basin at the bottom of the fountain and spill out onto the ground around the fountain. Tiny autumnal flower buds of crimson and orange tremble in the cold wind and the moonlight. So thick is the moss that you barely notice the decorative statues that perch at the head of the fountain.

    You carefully brush some of the moss off of the closest statue to discover a small robed cat holding aloft a wand, and several carved words underneath: <i>“...I pledge my wand in service...”</i>

    You make your way around the fountain, carefully removing moss to see find more robed animal statues, including a frog, a fox, a newt and an owl. Each raises a wand in salute, and each is captioned with the same motto.

    Within moments of your discovery, the fountain burbles loudly to life, a cascade of wet moss cascades out of the spigots, and the statues and engravings are completely obscured once more.

    The crow’s eye patch is fashioned of simple black leather, but seems to radiate magickal properties. Upon closer inspection, several silver runes are imprinted on the backside of the patch.

        You carefully strap the crow’s eye over your own and gaze out through the shimmering black lens. Immediately the world is transformed.

        Colors you never could have imagined before shimmer into focus throughout the darkness. Were you the most gifted poet in Liondon, you would not have words to describe the iridescent blues and silver hues you see traced throughout the pathway and the trees around you.

        Your new sight catches the gleam of the runes scratched onto the trunk of the tree. You think you can finally make sense of the letters:
        <i>“...to the coven and the good.”</i>

    The polished orb is spinning slowly and smoothly in the rainwater. On its gleaming mirrored face, you see four symbols inscribed: a bushy foxtail, a broken tree, an arched window, and a fountain.

    On the lip of the marble bowl is a star-shaped indentation.

    For the first time tonight, the clouds have parted enough for you to see a vast field of stars above. Nights are never this clear back at home, and you are amazed by the clarity of the innumerable stars you are seeing for the first time.

    You begin to lose yourself in wonder at the celestial view, when suddenly a strange cloud drifts in front of the stars, blotting out their light. The cloud moves quickly and then doubles back again. You realize with a shudder that what you are seeing is not a cloud, but a large winged <i>thing</i> wheeling on the wind far off over the forest. It vanishes from view once again, but your instincts scream at you to hide from its searching gaze.

        You unclasp the badger’s amulet from the chain, and insert it into the star-shaped indentation in the marble bowl. Immediately, the oracular metal hums with intention. Just as Mr. Bartley suggested, you have found its use.

        The starlight above slowly and steadily focuses and brightens on the amulet, as if the charm were collecting the light out of the night sky for its own purpose. Within a few moments, the amulet and the rainwater are dazzlingly bright in concentrated starlight.

        The orb begins to spin faster and faster in the bowl. You watch in amazement as it refracts the concentrated starlight through the water and onto the stone walls around you. Suddenly, the orb ceases its rotation all at once, and projects a mirrored image of one of its inscription on the stones: the outline of a broken window. 

        The orb resumes its blinding spin, and stops suddenly once again, now projecting the image of the fox tail.

        The orb spins a third time, landing on the fountain.

        The orb spins a fourth time, finally settling on the broken tree.

        The reflected image of the tree fades on the wall, the starlight in the bowl dims, and the orb sits heavy and still in the rain water.

        What in Lionworts did you just witness?

      A faint gleam of gold under one of the tree roots in the water catches your eye. You feel compelled to investigate by some unknown force, and creep closer to the stream.

      To your surprise, you find, submerged in a small eddy, a simple but hauntingly beautiful gold ring.

      You can see the delicate Elvish Tengwar script enscribed on the band, writing that glows brighter the more you concentrate on it. Your suspicions are confirmed... this is The One Ring, the Bane of Isildur, forged in secret by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom to gain dominion over the free peoples of Middle-Earth and won by Isildur during the War of the Last Alliance
    - ' Isildur, who cut the Ring from Sauron''s own hand and in so doing destroyed the Dark Lord''s physical form'
    - ' Isildur, who then refused to destroy the Ring by throwing it into the Fires of Mount Doom'
    - |2-
       Isildur, who was betrayed by the Ring itself and slain by Orcs in an ambush on the River Anduin near the Gladden Fields, and so allowed the Ring to remain undetected in the waters of a stream for nigh on two and a half millennia.

      It's probably best you just leave it where it is. You have more important things on your mind.
